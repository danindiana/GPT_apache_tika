This warning from PDFBox indicates that the font "T6" within one of your PDFs doesn't have a proper Unicode mapping for the character with code 44 (which usually corresponds to a comma ",").  This means Tika might not be able to accurately represent that character when extracting the text.

Here's why this happens and what you can do:

**Why the Warning Occurs**

* **Font Encoding:** PDFs can use various font encodings, and sometimes these encodings don't have a direct one-to-one mapping to Unicode, the standard character encoding used for text representation.
* **Missing Glyphs:** The font "T6" in your PDF might be missing the glyph (visual representation) for the character with code 44, or the mapping between that character code and its glyph is incorrect.
* **Font Subsetting:**  PDFs often use font subsetting, where only the characters used in the document are included in the PDF file. This can sometimes lead to incomplete font information.

**What You Can Do**

1. **Ignore the Warning (If Text Looks Okay):** If the extracted text looks fine and the missing character doesn't significantly affect the content, you can often ignore this warning.

2. **Check the Extracted Text:** Carefully examine the extracted text files to see if there are any obvious character errors or missing commas.

3. **Font Replacement (Advanced):**  If the missing character is critical, you could try more advanced techniques like font replacement using PDFBox. This involves programmatically replacing the problematic font with a similar font that has proper Unicode mappings. However, this requires more in-depth knowledge of PDFBox and font handling.

4. **Pre-process PDFs (If Possible):** If you have control over the PDF creation process, ensure that the PDFs are generated with embedded fonts that have complete Unicode mappings.

5. **Alternative Tools:** If accuracy is paramount and the warnings persist, you might consider exploring alternative PDF parsing libraries or tools that might handle the font issue differently.

**Important Note:**

These "No Unicode mapping" warnings are relatively common when working with PDFs, as font handling can be quite complex. Often, they don't significantly impact the extracted text, but it's always good to be aware of them and check the output for any inaccuracies.
